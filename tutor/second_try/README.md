Second try of implementing a RAG, this time using raw python libraries in order to have full control over the model.

This implementation was done using gemini. It came up with a good ideea but the implementation was pretty messy and it requires more time to debug. I decided to drop this and start again with smaller steps. This way I will have a very simple but functional RAG, from which I will be able to improve each component of it.
